# TF2-Regex-Trigger
**Serves as a regex trigger/filter for names, chat, and commands.**  
  
I have included the regex config file which I use for my servers.

*This plugin has included features which integrate the use of **SourceIRC** and **Discord** when connecting multiple servers.* 
https://github.com/Azelphur/SourceIRC (Original)  
https://github.com/JoinedSenses/SourceIRC (Modified)  
## Optional features:  
 * IRC: Method to relay 'connect' messages to a main IRC channel  
 * Discord: Method to relay filtered names and chat messages to a seperate channel for debugging/analysis.  
 * Notes: If using the discord api plugin, you're required to setup discord.cfg and to update /cfg/sourcemod/plugin.regextrigger.cfg

## Config Keys
**Warn:** Display a warning message to the player  
`"warn" "msg"`  
Allows you to give fair warning about your rules when they are broken  

**Action:** Executed if a pattern matches  
`"action" "rcon action"`  
"rcon action" can be any command you want, but there may be only one action per section.  
%n, %i, and %u will be replaced with the clients name, index, or userid, respectively, if they are in the command string.  

**Block:** Block the text absolutely (**Does not work for names**)   
`"block" "1"`  
Very simple, skips all the replacement stuff, does not skip the limiting step, so you can block and limit at the same time (limit the amount of times one can attempt to say it, and also block the words from being said)  

**Limit:** Limit the amount of times the matched action can occur  
`"limit" "number"`  
Also simple, will block if the client says the pattern more times than "number"  

**Forgive:** Forgives one indiscretion every x seconds  
`"forgive" "x"`  
Allows more flexibility with limiting. It might be ok to advertise once every five minutes, not every five seconds, so you can "forgive" a slip up every "x" seconds.  

**Punish:** executes a punishment command if limit is exceeded  
`"punish" "cmd"`  
"cmd" can be any command you want, but there may be only one punishment per section.  
%n, %i, and %u will be replaced with the clients name, index, or userid, respectively, if they are in the command string.  

**Replace:** Replaces matched text with a value.  
`"replace" "with"`  
Will replace the pattern's matches with "with", and check everything again.  
Supports use of capture groups greater than 0 by using \\#, such as \\1 or \\2  

**Relay:** Relays information to the related discord channel  
`"relay" "1"`  
If enabled and discord api is use, this will allow the plugin to relay messages to discord channels.
